Requirements
All of your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All of your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions and methods should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
Install Redis on Ubuntu 18.04
$ sudo apt-get -y install redis-server
$ pip3 install redis
$ sed -i "s/bind .*/bind 127.0.0.1/g" /etc/redis/redis.conf
Use Redis in a container
Redis server is stopped by default - when you are starting a container, you should start it with: service redis-server start

Tasks
0. Writing strings to Redis
mandatory
Create a Cache class. In the __init__ method, store an instance of the Redis client as a private variable named _redis (using redis.Redis()) and flush the instance using flushdb.

Create a store method that takes a data argument and returns a string. The method should generate a random key (e.g. using uuid), store the input data in Redis using the random key and return the key.

Type-annotate store correctly. Remember that data can be a str, bytes, int or float.

bob@dylan:~$ cat main.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Main file
"""
import redis

Cache = __import__('exercise').Cache

cache = Cache()

data = b"hello"
key = cache.store(data)
print(key)

local_redis = redis.Redis()
print(local_redis.get(key))

bob@dylan:~$ python3 main.py 
3a3e8231-b2f6-450d-8b0e-0f38f16e8ca2
b'hello'
bob@dylan:~$

1. Reading from Redis and recovering original type
mandatory
Redis only allows to store string, bytes and numbers (and lists thereof). Whatever you store as single elements, it will be returned as a byte string. Hence if you store "a" as a UTF-8 string, it will be returned as b"a" when retrieved from the server.

In this exercise we will create a get method that take a key string argument and an optional Callable argument named fn. This callable will be used to convert the data back to the desired format.
